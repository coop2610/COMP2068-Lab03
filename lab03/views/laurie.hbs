<p>Laurie is the mother of Amanda and Nicholas. She is a retired director of sales, and is very business savy. Laurie enjoys reading, and is always putting things away the second she sees something sitting out, even if you are still using it! Laurie loves her dog Jersey very much, which has led Jersey to become a scardy cat and very jealous of Laurie giving her attention to anyone but her.</p>
